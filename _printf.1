# man _printf

NAME

	_printf - output in the form of characters

SYNOPSIS

	#include "main.h"
    int _printf(const char *format, ...);

DESCRIPTION
       _printf() writes all the characters provided between double quotation marks. Moreover, it allows additional arguments to be converted and written at any desired position in the string of characters. To indicate the position, a specific conversion modifier must be present. The conversion modifiers supported by this function are the following:

	- %c	Will take a char type variable and print a character.

	- %s	Will take a char * type variable and print all the characters until but without including the null byte character.

	- %d	Will take an int type variable and print it as a character(s).

	- %i	Will take an int type variable and print it as a character(s).

	- %u	Will take an unsigned int type variable and print it as character(s).

	- %o	Will take an unsigned int type variable and print it in octal base as character(s).

	- %x	Will take an unsigned int type variable and print it in hexadecimal base as character(s).

	- %X	Will take an unsigned int type variable and print it in hexadecimal base (with capital letters) as character(s).

	- %%	Will just print a single percentage symbol.

	- %	If the follow up character is not included as a specific conversion modifier, the function will normally print both the percentage symbol and the follow up character, unless it is the Null byte, in which case it will result in an error.

       _printf() writes anything that is passed into it as long as its supported.

EXAMPLES
       _printf("Hello from the other side\n");

              Hello from the other side

       _printf("Hello %s the other side%c\n", "from", '!');

              Hello from the other side!

RETURN VALUE
       _printf() will return an int with the value equal to the lenght of the characters printed.

	   -1: Fatal error.
